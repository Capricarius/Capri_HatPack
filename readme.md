## About this pack
This is a Minecraft Texture pack which changes the models of items dependant on their `ModelData`

## Dependancies
[Custom Roleplay Datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/custom-roleplay-data-datapack)

## How to use
1. Get the item you want to change
    + If its a Hat then you need a carved pumpkin
2. Type in game `/trigger CustomModelData set {data}` - replace {data} with the data number
    + Every use of this command costs a level of XP
    + If using a carved pumpkin, make sure not to place it on the floor as it will revert back.
3. You now have your custom model !

If I do the following command on a carved pumpkin I will receive the `elfears` hats
- `/trigger CustomModelData set 2`
